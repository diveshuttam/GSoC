## Issues faced

- Couldn't work out revocation certificate generatation.
  I have asked the query on gnupg-devel

## To be done coming week

- Complete all tasks in pgpg that are remaining.
  - the remaining tasks are relativley basic and small.
  Nothing's conceptually new except may be retriving the keys 
  from the key server But for that also we have a sample example.
  
- Discuss on gnupg-devel about the current methods I used and filter out the code.

- Start to work with packaging of pgpg and egpg.
