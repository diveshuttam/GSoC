I was travelling from university to home today so could devote only around 3.5 hrs on PC. Following things were done during this time:
- Read the [wiki book on bash scripting](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting).
- Read a bit about the versioning schemes and best practices regarding git. Some relevent articles include
    - http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
    - https://semver.org/
- Went through my proposal again. Also visited some of the links that I had added in my proposal.  

Apart from this while travelling, caught up with the missed discussions on GitHub due to my exams.
Started with the book [The Linux Command Line](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lMwE7lMEaWhayBcDUMZQP9Lun1wROAXN/view). Since I didn't had my laptop in hand, could not be much productive. Just read 1 chapter from part 4 without implementing/trying things out. Will be continue with this for 15th and 16th.
