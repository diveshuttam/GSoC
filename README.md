# GSoC
GSoC work done for [pgpg](https://github.com/easygnupg/pgpg)

This repo will be used for 3 things:
1) As a scratchpad for trying nonmainstream things related to my GSoC project (learning, experimenting).
2) As a blog about my weekly progress on the project.
4) Any other relevent things that I find which could not fit in the main repo but are of use.
